# Tableau Dashboard - Spotify Streaming Data

![Dashboard Preview](Screenshots/Spotify-Streaming-Data-Dashboard.png)

## The purpose of this dashboard is to allow users to delve deeper into the data behind almost 1000 of Spotify's most streamed songs. The dashboard is built around a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, titled: 'Spotify Most Streamed Songs'. This file can be found above in the repository. 

# I have included visuals on the following variables:

## - Most Streamed Artists
## - Most Streamed Songs
## - Highest Energy Songs
## - BPM (Beats per Minute)
## - Number of Times Artist is Featured in Playlists

# I have also included filters on the page to help narrow your search. These include:

## - Release Month
## - Artist Name Search Bar

## Please read on to find detailed explanations of how I put together different aspects of this dashboard:

# Things that could be improved

Whilst the dataset did include a large range of 'release years' for different tracks, going back all the way to 1930, 90% of all the tracks included were released in the last 10 years. For this reason it made less sense to include using 'release year' as a filter, because the amount of data from the majority of the years was very limited.

The dataset did not actually specify over what time period these results were collected. I have made the assumption that this data is based on all available data (up until mid-2024).

The dataset did not have a column for 'genre' which would have been a useful and interesting variable to analyse in this context. In any future analysis I would look to find data that included this as a column.
